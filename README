Lets you easily close all open parens up to the cursor line.

I tested it quickly with Scheme, but it should also work with Lisp.

(define foo
  (lambda(x)
    (+ x 1

Put your cursor on the last line (or below), and type <Leader>p
It will become

(define foo
  (lambda(x)
    (+ x 1)))

I chose "p" as in "parens", for it is easy to remember. I would have preferred "c" as in "close", but <leader>c is already taken by the good EnhancedCommentify :D


I apologize for this script beeing a dirty quick hack, but writing in vim's script language is a real pain, and this script is enough useful to me to choose to share it.
I should at least clean it by the following weeks.
